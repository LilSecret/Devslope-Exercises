      <p class="blog-text">
        “The God of Israel is a magnificent and caring person. He loves all and
        all he asks is that you believe on his only begotten son that he sent to
        die on the cross to pay for our sins. His son, Jesus, was a wonderful
        example and had love like no other. He was one with his father: in the
        flesh, and showed his miracles and amazing glory. His love was
        everlasting. Repent of your evil sings and believe on his name. You
        shall in return gain eternal life. He is the light and the bread of this
        world. The only way to heaven is through him. There is no other way and
        you must seek his righteousness and glorious ways. Give all you problems
        to him and he will carry you on his shoulders. He is king and we are all
        his children. We must seek to spread the word and save others. No master
        is greater than his servant, for we are all equal and deserve his love.
        His love is the greatest and is true. He is the most beautiful one in
        existence. ”

        “On the other hand, Those who do not seek him and do evils, will perish
        in the lake of fire. The place where the fire does not quench. Seek to
        become him and deny thyself. Take up your cross and follow him. He is
        the only way. He is the door. Those who try to enter the kingdom a
        different way such as a window or through the roof, is like unto a
        robber or thief. They will be seen and nothing is hid from thee. You're
        like unto a candle stick in a room, All who enter will see your light.
        If it be good they shall marvel and glorify the amazing God. Though if
        it is evil, You should worry and know that you time might be up soon.
        Change your ways and become great in his eyes. He is the true light.
        Follow him and never turn your back!”
