          <p>
            Jesus was born inside a manger in Bethlehem. There was no other
            rooms in the inns so they had to stay inside a little farm area.
            Mary, his mom, along with her husband Joseph, had birthed Jesus
            there surrounded by the farm animals. A bright star appeared in the
            sky. People saw it and knew something special had happened.

          <p>
            This is the time when the wise men brought there gifts to give to
            the new king who was born. They brought three gifts: gold,
            frankincense, and myrrh.

          <p>
            This was the time when Mary and Joseph went back to Jerusalem after
            the ones who sought to destroy the king had passed on. This was the
            time when Jesus was in the temple speaking to the elders. They were
            astonished at his doctrine.

          <p>
            This is the time when Jesus had gone to elias (John the baptist) and
            asked to be baptized by him. Elias did so and the heavens opened and
            a voice came out saying, "This is my beloved son. Whom I love and am
            well pleased.", two doves came down and Jesus had obtained the holy
            spirit. Jesus had left for 40 days and the devil had tempted him.
            Jesus stayed true to his father.

            Jesus gathers his 12 disciples to follow and see the wonderful
            miracles that God can do. They are amazed and glorify God. They are
            take up their cross and follow Jesus.

            healings</span

          <p>
            Jesus is one with the Father in heaven and teaches his people and
            shows them who the one true God is. Jesus heals the deaf to hear,
            the dumb to speak, paralyzed to walk, and even the dead to rise. All
            in his father's name, which is the God of David, God of Jacob, and
            the God of Israel.

            resurrection</span
          >
          <p>
            The scribes and the pharisees see the wonders and miracles Jesus
            does and get jealous. They get him arrested for blasphemy and when
            he was decided what to do with amongst the people. The scribes and
            pharisee turned the people against and they had sought to destroy
            and have him killed. They crucify him in Golgotha (which is a place
            of bones).

            On the third day Jesus had risen and met with his disciples in
            Galilee. He had shown them his doctrine was true. He returned to his
            father which is in heaven.
